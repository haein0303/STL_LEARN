The Containers library is a generic collection of class templates and algorithms
that allow programmers to easily implement common data structures like queues,
lists and stacks. There are three classes of containers -- 
sequence containers, associative containers, and unordered associative containers -- 
each of which is designed to support a different set of operations.

The container manages the storage space that is allocated for 
its elements and provides member functions to access them, 
either directly or through iterators (objects with properties similar to pointers).

Most containers have at least several member functions in common, 
and share functionalities. Which container is the best 
for the particular application depends not only on the offered functionality, 
but also on its efficiency for different workloads.
